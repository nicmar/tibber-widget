A nice graph showing todays prices as a graph on the lock screen or home screen using Scriptable.
Also shows tomorrows prices when those are available.

Requires a subscription to Tibber.

1) Join the Testflight Beta of Scriptable (Lock screen support is only available in this version)
https://testflight.apple.com/join/uN1vTqxk

2) Sign up on https://developer.tibber.com/ and get an API token

3) Copy and paste the script into a new script in Scriptable. Make sure to insert your API token.

4) Edit the lock screen and add the new widget

## Future updates
- I'd like to have it change at 13.00 and update the graph to show today 12-23 and tomorrow 00-11. The tomorrow data is already in priceObject.tomorrow
- Adjust the two digit numbers under the graph that is a tiiiiny bit too much to the right.
- Use the vertical space better in the Home screen widget and maybe adjust the layout a bit.

If you like to update it, feel free to make a PR :)
